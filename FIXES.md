# 🔧 Azure Multi-Agent AI Platform - Error Fixes Summary

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. KeyError: 'azure_connection_string'
**Problem**: Agent configuration was trying to access 'azure_connection_string' but the field was named 'connection_string'
**Solution**: Updated all references in `ui_components.py` to use 'connection_string' consistently

### 2. Circular Import Error
**Problem**: `ui_components.py` was importing from `multi_agent_app.py` while `multi_agent_app.py` was importing from `ui_components.py`
**Solution**: 
- Created separate `azure_utils.py` module for Azure classes
- Moved `AzureConfig` and `EnhancedAzureAIAgentClient` to `azure_utils.py`
- Updated imports in both files to use `azure_utils`

### 3. Function Name Mismatch
**Problem**: Test script was trying to import `show_user_management` but function was renamed to `show_settings`
**Solution**: Updated test script to import correct function name
